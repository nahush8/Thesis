  Abstract                 = {Target tracking is a fundamental problem in robotics research and has been the subject of detailed studies over the years. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation, based on the mathematical concept of random finite sets, that allows for tracking an unknown and dynamic number of mobile targets with a team of robots. We show how to employ the Probability Hypothesis Density filter to simultaneously estimate the number of targets and their positions. Next, we present a greedy algo- rithm for assigning trajectories to the robots that maximize submodular objective functions and prove that this is a 2-approximation. We examine two such objective functions: the mutual information between the estimated target positions and future measurements from the robots, and the expected number of targets detected by the robot team. We provide extensive simulation evaluations using a real-world dataset.}

The practice of precision agriculture offers many benefits towards addressing these challenges, such as improved yield and efficient use of such resources as water, fertilizer and pesticides. We describe the design and development of a light-weight, multi-spectral 3D imaging device that can be used for automated monitoring in precision agriculture. The sensor suite consists of a laser range scanner, multi-spectral cameras, a thermal imaging camera, and navigational sen@inproceedings{bou2010controller,

We demonstrate its use with two systems: multi-rotor micro aerial vehicles and on a human-carried, shoulder-mounted harness. We show results of field experiments conducted in collaboration with growers and agronomists in vineyards, apple orchards and orange groves.},
